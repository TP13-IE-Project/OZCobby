A theme called Big Bob.

== Description ==

This theme features maximizing the use of images as a way to give a site a unique look.  
It does this by creating a layout that adapts well to a variety of different header videos and header images as well as background images.  
It also gives users the option to decide how to allow mobile browsers to utilize images and videos.  
Users may find that they can create a unique look by just uploading a video and a few images. 
Finally, it includes a sticky navbar and slidepanel menu for mobile browsers.

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
